"using a commandline app, code a app that makes a rover move around: up, down,
left, and right"

## my answer

- using python because that's the programming language I know best and can
  cover most requirements
- TDD: use unit tests throughout

## local setup 🏠

make sure you have `python3` installed and available

make `setup.sh` script executable: `chmod +x setup.sh`

run `setup.sh` script be able to run the project's test unit suite

```bash
source ./setup.sh
```

## running unit tests 🧪

```bash
pytest
```

## play with the rover 🚚

```bash
python src/user_interface.py
```
