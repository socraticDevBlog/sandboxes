A table listing recommended and final penalties for each officer with a
substantiated complaint of misconduct since the year 2000. Non-charges cases go
through the Department Advocate's Office (DAO) and are recorded as non-APU

Administrative Prosecution Unit (APU) and are marked as APU penalties and
recommendations. In all cases the NYPD Commissioner will issue a final penalty,
