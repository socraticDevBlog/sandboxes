# recursion

In programming, recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve
a problem. This is done by breaking down the problem into smaller, self-similar
subproblems until a base case is reached, at which point the recursion stops
and the solution is returned

Recursive solutions are often used when a problem can be naturally broken down
into smaller versions of itself

## components

### base case

Every recursive function needs a base case, which is a condition that stops the
recursion and provides a final result.

### recursive steps

the function calls itself; usually with a slightly modified input parameter

## classic challenges

Here are some simple and classic problems that can be solved by recursion and
are perfect for introducing bright teenagers to this concept:

Calculating the Factorial ✅ 
Explain how to calculate n! = n × (n-1) × ... × 1 recursively.

Fibonacci Sequence
Demonstrate how to generate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence using a
recursive function.

Summing a List of Numbers
Add all the elements of a list or array recursively.

Finding an Element in a List
Implement a recursive search in a list (e.g., sequential search).

Reversing a String
Reverse a string (or array) using recursion.

Traversing a Binary Tree
Demonstrate how to traverse a tree (e.g., prefix, infix, postfix) recursively.

Solving the Towers of Hanoi Problem
A classic example of the power of recursion and the decomposition of a complex problem.

Calculating the sum of the digits of a number ✅ 
For example, the sum of the digits of 1234 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4.
