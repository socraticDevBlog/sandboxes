# Machine Learning with Python - Practical Application

## course focus
- model selection
- model training
- performance assessment


### learning styles

- supervised
- semi-supervised
- unsupervised
  
### algorithm types

- regression ✔️
  - process for estimating the relationship between a continuous response
    variabye `y` and a set of variables `x` that describe `y`
    - linear regression (estimating a linear relationship between 1::*
      explanatory variables `x` and a scalar response `y`)
        - assumes a linear relationship
        - expect numerical values only
        - sensible to outliers
        - parametric algorithm
- classification ✔️
  - logistic regression
  - naive Bayes
  - support vector machines
  - K nearest neighbors
  - decision trees and random forests
  - neural networks
  - convolutional neural networks
- dimensionality reduction ✔️
  - linear discriminant analysis (lda)
  - principal component analysis (pca)
  - T distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
- clustering ✔️ (essential to non-supervized learning)
  - clustering algorithms
  - K means
  - Gaussian mixtures
  - hierchical clustering
  - affinity propagation
- transfer learning
- sound classification
- object detection
- time series analysis
- natural language processing (nlp)
- video classification
- generative AI
- reinforcement learning

## locally

### requirements

- [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to install, manage, and run dependencies in a python virtual environment
- latest NodeJS version (optionnal: use `nvm install`)

### commands

```
pipenv install

pipenv run jupyter lab
```
