# Machine Learning with Python - Practical Application

## course focus
- model selection
- model training
- performance assessment


### learning styles

- supervised
- semi-supervised
- unsupervised
  
### algorithm types

- regression ✔️
  - process for estimating the relationship between a continuous response
    variabye `y` and a set of variables `x` that describe `y`
    - linear regression (estimating a linear relationship between 1::*
      explanatory variables `x` and a scalar response `y`)
        - assumes a linear relationship
        - expect numerical values only
        - sensible to outliers
        - parametric algorithm
- classification ✔️
- dimensionality reduction ✔️
- clustering ✔️
- time-series forecasting
- natural language processing
- anomaly detection
- ranking
- recommendation
- data generation
- optimization
- object detection
